In terms of Revenue generation. “Apple” Brand is generating the maximum revenue.  However, we can say that these two brands are the most trusted brands among all.

•	Discounts are not much effective as we can clearly observe that the Portion Size of product purchased by customer on discounted amount is much low than the Purchased portion size of product without discount on a particular date.
•	It has been observed that on Product ID 871. The maximum sales revenue has occurred on 17 Nov 2019 while the discount on this product was live on 28 Nov 2019. The sales on the date on which discount was live were only $8,247 while the highest sales amount on a particular day have gone up to $43,506.
